            React Native, a framework developed by Facebook, enables us to build beautiful, native mobile applications
            using JavaScript. It's fast, efficient, and gives us the ability to create apps for both iOS and Android 
            from a single codebase. Coupled with MongoDB, a flexible, scalable, and high-performance NoSQL database, 
            we can build robust full-stack applications that can handle complex data and scale with your needs.
